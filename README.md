# Milestone 1: Front-End Project

This project is the first milestone in TECHCareers Software Developer program.

This assignment is for you to make a resume website that has a ‘Contact Me’ form. The resume must contain your own personal information regarding your Goals/Objectives, your Work Experience, your Education, and any other relevant information about your career that you want future employers to know about. For this assignment you are not allowed to put your contact information (phone, mailing address, etc) on your webpage as this can leave you vulnerable to scammers. The Contact Me form will be a form that allows users to write an email to you using a mailto link as the form’s action (in the example we have linked the form’s action is made for php. You will have to research how to do this using mailto on your own). Your contact form will also have to validate user input using JavaScript before it open’s the user’s email client to send the form.
